# Process-Scheduler-Simulator
A Python-based GUI simulator for CPU scheduling algorithms. The project includes a process generator based on user input and supports multiple scheduling algorithms: FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, and Priority. It visualizes the execution using Gantt charts for each algorithm, helping to understand how each scheduler handles processes
